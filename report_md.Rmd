# Report Description

This report examines data simulation, exporation, and modeling analysis. The exploration portion of the project utilizes data visualization and MANOVA analysis. Modeling will begin with simple regression, and then move to multivariate multiple regression, ending with path analysis. 

**Predictor variables:**

* Age
* Gender
* Background TV
* Touchscreen use
* Night-time sleep duration
* Daytime sleep duration
* Average number of night awakenings
* Sleep onset

**Outcome variables:**

* Night-time sleep duration
* Daytime sleep duration
* Sleep onset
* Average number of night awakenings

# Data Simulation

**Touchscreen Variables:**

```

##Age

I chose to simulate the age data with uniform distribution instead of rnorm, because there's no mention of normal distribution of age in the article. Additionally, normal distribution insinuates that there are very few samples on the lower and upper limits of each age group. This is not indicated in the paper. This makes uniform distribution a better option. 

```{r}
age.6_11 <- runif(n=total.n.6_11, min = 6, max = 11.9)
sd(age.6_11)
# sim sd: ~ 1.7
# original sd: 1.82
age.12_18 <- runif(n=total.n.12_18, min = 12, max = 18.9)
sd(age.12_18)
# sim sd: ~ 2.0
# original sd: 2.19

age.19_25 <- runif(n=total.n.19_25, min = 18, max = 25.9)
sd(age.19_25)
# sim sd: ~ 2.4
# original sd: 2.07

age.26_36 <- rnorm(n=total.n.26_36, mean=30.64, sd=3.07)
age.26_36 <- runif(n=total.n.26_36, min = 26, max = 36.9)
sd(age.26_36)
# sim sd: ~ 3.1
# original sd: 3.07

# vectors with imputed data for future simulation needs

                              mean(screen.6_11, na.rm=TRUE))
impute_screen.12_18 <- replace(screen.12_18, is.na(screen.12_18), 
                               mean(screen.12_18, na.rm=TRUE))

                               mean(screen.26_36, na.rm=TRUE))

```
*For each age group*, the following steps were taken: 

1. Use rnorm to simulate data with the total n for the age group, discounting NA's for the time being, because we need the full indices in order to combine into a later df with age. 
2. Replace negative values with 0. Because this will raise the mean, I lowered the initial mean chosen with rnorm. 
3. Add in NA values based on the difference in the total n and the n for touchscreen use. 

**Note:** The final standard deviation values are not ideal using this procedure, but I decided that staying closer to the true mean (found in the original data set) was more important.


## Sex
```{r}
sex.6_11 <- rep(x = "Female", times = total.n.6_11)
sex.6_11[sample(1:length(sex.6_11), size=ceiling(total.n.6_11*0.5149), 
                replace = FALSE)] <- "Male"

sex.12_18 <- rep(x = "Female", times = total.n.12_18)
sex.12_18[sample(1:length(sex.12_18), size=ceiling(total.n.12_18*0.5302), 
                 replace = FALSE)] <- "Male"


sex.19_25 <- rep(x = "Female", times = total.n.19_25)
sex.19_25[sample(1:length(sex.19_25), size=ceiling(total.n.19_25*0.5587), 
                 replace = FALSE)] <- "Male"

               replace = FALSE)] <- "Male"

sex <- c(sex.6_11, sex.12_18, sex.19_25, sex.26_36)

```

*For each age group*, the following steps were taken: 

1. Use rep to create a vector with the total length N with "Female" as each value
2. Replace "Female" with "Male" based on the percetage of the age group that is male in the original data set

*For each age group*, the following steps were taken: 

1. Weighted values for each TV sample were created using:
- (0.8 weight) Ratio of mean background TV and mean touchscreen use * the touchscreen use vector (with imputed mean data where there were previously NAs)
- (0.2 weight) Mean TV + random noise
2. Negative values were set to 0
-This was beneficial to the final mean values, so the original values were not altered as was seen when this step was taken with touchscreen use
3. NAs were added based on difference in n for this feature and overall

**Note:** It would be possible to simulate this data in the manner used to simulate the screen time data, but I hypothesize that children that are more likely to use touchscreens are also more likely to be exposed to background TV. This is not stated in the article, but is an assumption I am making. If this was not my assumption, then I could simulate this data independent of the touchscreen values, just replicating the mean and SD for each age group

*For each age group*, the following steps were taken: 

1. Weighted values for each night-time sleep duration sample were created using:
  - (0.8 weight) Ratio of mean night-time sleep duration and mean touchscreen use * the touchscreen use vector (with imputed mean data where there were previously NAs)
  - (0.2 weight) Mean night-time sleep duration + random noise
  - The floor or ceiling function and an added value that was chosen based on what created a reasonable overall mean value
2. Negative values were set to 0
-This was beneficial to the final mean values, so the original values were not altered as was seen when this step was taken with touchscreen use
3. NAs were added based on difference in n for this feature and overall
